## Hi there 👋
I'm **Natalia Justyna Miklós** (she/her), and I recently earned my **M.Sc. in Computer Science** from [Chemnitz University of Technology](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/index.html.en) (September 2025). My thesis explored how **deep learning and foundation models** can be applied to **human activity recognition** in **smart homes** using **edge devices**. I collected real-world data with a limited number of affordable, privacy-preserving ambient sensors and evaluated different approaches under the hardware constraints of a Raspberry Pi 3 in terms of accuracy and resource usage. See my [related repository](https://github.com/njmiklos/thesis-scripts-har-smart-home) for details.

Before Computer Science, I completed an **M.A. in English and American Studies**, which shaped my interdisciplinary perspective. Transitioning into tech has given me flexibility, demonstrates my curiosity and a unique ability to connect human and machine understanding of information.
### 💻 Technical Experience & Projects
- Contributed to [speech synthesis tools](https://github.com/njmiklos/pronunciation-dictionary-utils) and developed a [graphical user interface](https://github.com/njmiklos/synthesis-gui) for a command-line application.  
- Worked on transcription of lingustic data for a machine learning project in research on a [credible conversational pedagogical agent](https://hybrid-societies.org/en/research/d03/).  

These projects extended my foundation in **C/C++** with **Python**, **Django**, **JavaScript**, **Git**, and **shell scripting**, while learning to quickly adapt to new languages and tools.
### 🌍 Beyond Tech
My background includes teaching English and Polish to adults in English and German, organizing student art workshops, and editing a university magazine, all experiences that strengthened my communication, collaboration, and leadership skills.
### 🌱 Outside of Work
Beyond coding, I'm a dedicated knitter and beginner seamstress, a proud cat mom to two, and a serial plant propagator. I recharge through strength training, and have a soft spot for books, baking, and video games.
### 🔍 Looking Ahead
**I'm actively seeking opportunities in Computer Science / Software Engineering, where I can apply my interdisciplinary background, grow my expertise, and contribute to impactful projects in AI, software development, and beyond.**
