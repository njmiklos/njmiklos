## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is **Natalia Justyna MiklÃ³s** (she/her).

ðŸŽ“ I recently (23.09.2025) completed my **Master of Science in Computer Science** at [Chemnitz University of Technology](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/index.html.en).  

My thesis investigated how **deep learning and foundation models** can be applied to **human activity recognition in smart homes** on **edge devices**. I collected real-world data with affordable, privacy-preserving ambient sensors and compared deep learning and foundation models on the same activity annotation task, under identical hardware constraints of Raspberry Pi 3. The study focused on trade-offs in **accuracy and resource efficiency**. See my [related repository](https://github.com/njmiklos/thesis-scripts-har-smart-home) for details.

Before that, I earned a **Master of Arts in English and American Studies** at the same university.

**Iâ€™m now seeking a position in Computer Science / Software Engineering where I can apply and expand my skills.**

### Experience & Projects
- Contributed to [speech synthesis tools](https://github.com/njmiklos/pronunciation-dictionary-utils) and developed a [graphical user interface](https://github.com/njmiklos/synthesis-gui) for a command-line application.  
- Worked on transcription of lingustic data for a machine learning project in research on a [credible conversational pedagogical agent](https://hybrid-societies.org/en/research/d03/).  
- These projects extended my foundation in **C/C++** with hands-on skills in **Python, Django, JavaScript, Git, and shell scripting**, while learning to quickly adapt to new languages and tools.
### Beyond Tech
Before transitioning into IT, I built strong communication and organizational skills:  
- Taught **English and Polish** to adults in both English and German.  
- Organized art workshops and edited a student magazine as part of the **student council**, promoting international student visibility at my university.
### Outside of Tech  
Beyond coding, Iâ€™m a dedicated knitter and beginner seamstress, a cat mom to two, and a serial plant propagator. I recharge through fitness and biking, and have a soft spot for books, baking, and video games.

âœ¨ With a bold career transition from English Studies to Computer Science, I bring **flexibility, curiosity, and motivation** to deepen my expertise in software engineering.  My interdisciplinary background makes me a **unique link between human and machine understanding of information**.
